# Business Impact — AI Safety Sandbox

## Strategic Risks
Real user sentiment illustrates the trust deficit:

- “Replit AI just **deleted my entire folder** with no warning.”  
- “I can’t trust it on production projects.”  

These complaints translate directly to churn risk:
- Unsafe AI → support costs, negative PR
- Trust deficit → lower AI adoption, lost revenue


## Value Proposition
- **Visible guardrails** → higher user trust
- **Prevent costly incidents** (DB wipes, destructive ops)
- **Differentiate as the safest AI agent platform**

## Financial Impact (Illustrative)
- 200k AI users × $10/mo × 12 months = $24M ARR
- 5% churn reduction = $12M revenue protected
- Preventing 1 major outage per year = immeasurable reputational savings

## Metrics to Track
- % risky actions blocked
- AI adoption rate
- AI-related support ticket volume
- NPS before vs after guardrails
